                 The current methods to make sure online shoppers receive what they expect are small descriptive texts that state the material 
                 and/or the size the model was wearing. Users need a <strong>personalized method </strong>of making sure they receive what is expected and to their liking.

            <h3>Competitive Audit</h3>
            <p> The audit was conducted on three competitors based on <strong>4 factors; products offered, target audience, unique value proposition,
                and personalization process.</strong> The main findings revealed that many platforms that offer personalization are directed
                towards appealing to other businesses rather than individual consumers.

            <p> 
                Conducted a usability study to figure out if the personalization process was intuitive, if the process increased the 
                likelihood of users liking the product, and if there were any difficulty or confusion while using Tailored. The key 
                performance indicators for the study were <strong>time on task, conversion rates, user error rates, and system usability scale.</strong>

            <p> • a less cluttered personalization process to <strong>decrease time on task and increase conversion rates.</strong></p> 
            <p> • call to action buttons for providing information during the personalization process to <strong>decrease user error rates.</strong> </p>

                • <strong>Less is more</strong> in the context of fitting too much content in one space can significantly reduce the appeal of your design, as well as the usability. 
            </p>
            <p>
                • It’s easy to get diverted from the initial problem so always keep the <strong>bigger picture </strong>in mind when making decisions.
